*voicemail* "Detective, we have a situation. There seems to be a disturbance over on Amazon Hill. The residents have
been experiencing some unexplained events taking place in their home. After speaking to the madam, this may be up your
alley. I know you may not be inclined due to the previous turning out to be a hoax... but I assure you, this one is
not sitting right. The details have been sent by courier, happy hunting...

I slowly walked towards the house, the leaves crunching under my feet. The broken gates were open, creaking in the wind
and felt wet and as cold as ice. On either side were demented gargoyles. It was a dark, cold night. The lightning lit up
the house and the thunder sent shock-waves down my spine. The house was dark and gloomy. It had narrow broken windows and
an open wooden porch, it looked abandoned but it shouldn't be, a light was on in the attic room. I started to hear faint
singing in the distance as my heart began to beat faster as I continued to walk past the bare trees towards the front door.
